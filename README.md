Data Science Final Project Proposal: Guess the Vegetable Price!
Description & Exploratory Data Analysis:
The dataset we chose was data about vegetables in the thakuranichak market. The dataset
features six different variables and one output: Vegetables, Season, Month, Temperature,
Disaster, Vegetable Condition, and Price per Kilogram. The vegetable variable is the type of
vegetable sold at the market. Season is the season in which the vegetables were bought. The
month variable is the month in which the vegetable was bought. The temperature variable
describes the temperature outside when the vegetables were bought (in celsius). The disaster
variable describes whether or not a disaster has taken place in the last three months of the
vegetable being purchased. Vegetable Condition describes the condition of the vegetable when it
was bought. Lastly, the price per kilogram, which is the price per kilogram that the vegetables
were bought at.
We plan to use the dataset to predict what the cost of a particular vegetable will be based on the 6
different feature variables. The graphs we will use are box plot, scatterplot, â€¦, and we will make
these to show the features variables compared to the price of the vegetable per kilogram
(output variable).
The Dataset: Vegetable Dataset
Models:
The 4 models we plan to use are:
1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso/Ridge Regression
3. Decision Tree
4. Random Forest Regression
Evaluation Metrics:
The evaluation metrics we will be using are:
1) R2 value
2) Confusion Matrix
3) Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score, and Recall
4) Root Mean Square Error
Workload Distribution:
As a group we are dividing the workload based on the Models and Evaluation Metrics. Everett
will be using the Lasso/Ridge Regression model and the R2 value evaluation metric. Yonathan
will be using the Random Forest Regression model and the Root Mean Square Error evaluation
metric. Connor will be using the Linear Regression model and the Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score,
and Recall evaluation metric. Lastly, Austin will be using the Decision Tree model and the
Confusion Matrix evaluation metric. Each member of the group will work on the powerpoint
according to the model and evaluation metric they have addressed and if any assistance is needed
the group will be there to assist.
